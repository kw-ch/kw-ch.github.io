Visible Light Communication (VLC) is a form of wireless communication technology that using visible light as the communication medium.

# Why VLC? 
One of the main attractions of VLC is its potential to help overcome a problem known as the 'spectrum crunch'. A spectrum crunch is where the growing number of wireless devices starts to outpace the amount of available wireless frequency spectra.

This is a particular concern as more and more devices these days are outfitted with wireless technology. The fact that common wireless communication protocols such as WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc all predominantly use the 2.4GHz band further exacerbates this problem. 

There are plenty of other benefits to VLC as well, such as its inherent security (you can 'lock' light in a room by closing the doors and windows), it can work in places where RF may pose a problem such as hospitals and airplanes, etc. 

# How does VLC work?
VLC works by modulating a light source (usually an LED) to encode digital data. On the receiving end, these light signals are detected and then demodulated to obtain the original data. 

The most common form of VLC modulation schemes are pulse-based, modulating the digital data on a train of pulses to vary the intensity of the LED. An example of this is Variable Pulse Position Modulation, which is essentially a combination of PWM and PPM where the digital data is encoded on the position of the pulses and the pulse width is varied to provide a dimming function. 

Dimming and Flickering are two of the most important considerations when it comes to VLC. 

Dimming is a staple feature in modern lighting, allowing users to adjust the brightness of their lights according to their preferences. However, dimming sort of works against VLC because it can reduce the data rate and decrease the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This can introduce more errors and reduce the maximum commmunication range. One possible way of addressing this is by incorporating an adaptive modulation technique that allows the VLC system to change the modulaton scheme based on the channel conditions. For example, when the lights are dimmed, this might trigger a switch to a modulation scheme with a slower data rate but better error resiliency.

Flickering is another problem as it can cause discomfort and other health concerns in humans. Generally, VLC systems try to operate at speeds well above the **flicker fusion threshold**, which represents the frequency at which the human eye can no longer perceive flickering. However, flicker can arise as a result of many factors such as a slow modulation rate, or even the response time of the LED itself.
