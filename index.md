title: About

Hello there, I'm kw-ch, electrical engineering student and avid electronics hobbyist. My professional interests are in embedded systems, electronics design, and biomedical engineering. In my spare time, I like to build things with the STM32 and ESP32 microcontrollers to solve practical problems. 

Here, I mainly blog about topics in electronics and embedded systems. I also (infrequently) write about projects I'm working on, both personal projects and academic projects in university.
