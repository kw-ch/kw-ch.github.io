So you want to take up electronics as a hobby. Well, that's easy, just spend 4 years getting an engineering degree and invest thousands in expensive tools. 

Just kidding!

Beginners tend to think of hobby electronics as some black magic that requires years of study to understand and a bottomless wallet to get started in. But really, it's not that way at all. You can get started right now. With zero knowledge and zero tools. Yes, really. 

# How do I get started?
Generally speaking, there are two common approaches to getting started with electronics:

1. Start learning the theory of something that interests you and let your knowledge direct what sort of projects you do. Rinse and repeat. 

2. Pick a project to do (there's plenty of websites where people post theirs and you can take inspiration from) then figure what you need to learn in order to complete the project. 

However, you must know that approach #2 is a beginner trap. Far too often I see people choose to work on some advanced project because it looked cool without realizing how complicated it actually is. Then, they encounter frustation and eventually give up. 

Approach #2 is perfectly fine once you're at an intermediate level where you know how things work and how to achieve them. That way, you can discern which projects are within your capabilities and which aren't. 

I always recommend approach #1 to anyone who asks me how to get started, coupling it with long-term project goals that start off simple. Yes, theory is boring and yes, building simple stuff is boring, but it builds essential skills and knowledge that you can expand upon which allows you to slowly but surely step up the level of your projects. 


# Do I need any equipment?
The basics to get started are a breadboard, a multimeter, a power supply (can just be batteries or one of those breadboard power supply modules), a soldering kit and maybe some hand tools like side cutters. Components and other equipment can be purchased only when you need it. 

Obviously, you shouldn't buy some fancy stuff (unless you've got money to burn) until you know you need them AND you're sure that you'll be sticking with electronics as a hobby. If you're a university student, you could even get away with using the tools in the electronics labs (it's also a good way to see what equipment you may need to buy). 

If you do decide to splurge a bit more, the first thing you should splurge on is a higher quality soldering iron. Look for something like the T12/TS100/TS80/Pinecil. Trust me, a good quality soldering iron will make soldering a joy and if well-maintained, can last you for many years and even decades (I had mine for 6 years now and it's as good as new).
