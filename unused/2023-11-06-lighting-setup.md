title: The quest for the perfect lighting setup

Throughout the past 3 years, I have been spending quite a significant amount of time (and money) on finding the perfect lighting setup for my room. From lightbulbs with different lumen outputs and color temperatures to different types of lighting fixtures, it was a long journey to get to this point (even then I don't think I'm completely satisfied and honestly at this point I think my eyes may have a light sensitivity problem).

So the lighting in my room at first used to be 4 ceiling lights. This was what I lived with for most of my life and honestly I didn't have much of a problem at first. However, things changed during COVID lockdowns where I started to spend significantly more time on my PC at home. After a while, my eyes would feel really tired and heavy but I don't exactly feel sleepy either. I would decide to go to sleep when this happens only to find myself wide awake in bed and the discomfort in my eyes being gone as well. 

So I started looking into some basic information about lighting setups. The first thing I found out is that the lightbulbs I'm currently using in my ceiling lights are way too bright (1500 lumens each!) and having four of them in a relatively small room makes it way too bright for comfort. Hence I started experimenting with lightbulbs that have a lower lumen output, going down to 1000 lumens and eventually 500 lumens. 

This definitely improved my experience a bit but there was still some eyestrain. Though the brightness is lower now, the next issue lies in the placement of the ceiling lights with the two biggest offenders being the one directly above my desk and one on the ceiling behind me. These lights create a lot of glare and also casted shadows over my desk. 

Removing either one of these lights didn't really help because it would make things too dark and/or unevenly lit. At this point, I decided to look into alternative solutions for lighting than ceiling lights. After a bit of reading, I stumbled upon uplighters which are essentially floor lamps that point upwards rather than radiating light in all directions. 

I got one from IKEA and the difference was quite apparent. The lighting was definitely a lot more diffused and evenly distributed as the light reflects off the ceiling rather than being directly shone down on me. This was an significant improvement but didn't completely eliminate my eyestrain problems. This time,  I traced the problem back to the fact that the lightbulb used for the uplighter is still a lightbulb that radiates light in all directions. Since I have the uplighter right next to my desk, this essentially means that I have a relatively bright lightbulb within my field of view at all times which is definitely contributing to my eyestrain. To fix this, I changed the lightbulb to a spotlight type lightbulb. Now, my uplighter fully shines light upwards and no other direction.

At this point, we're getting quite close and yet still so far away from the perfect lighting setup. While the spotlight bulbs helped direct light coming from the uplighter, there was still glare from the uplighter due to the light hitting the walls. This created quite a bright spot, which again is in my field of view. So this is essentially just the same problem as before but on a smaller scale. 

This was when I heard about bias
