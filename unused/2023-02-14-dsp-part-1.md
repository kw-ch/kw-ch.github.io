Signal processing is one of my favourite topics in electrical engineering. It is vastly useful and can help us gain insight into the things that we can observe around us, particularly things that we can hear and listen to. 

However as a student and hobbyist, my main gripe with most signal processing classes in school and books as well is that they are often very theoretical, with little emphasis on their application. As I began exploring signal processing on my own, I discovered that the world of signal processing is much more than what I was taught in school.

Hence the purpose of this series of posts is to present signal processing concepts and techniques in a more practical approach. Of course, there's no running from the relevant maths but hopefully this would make it a lot more digestible.
