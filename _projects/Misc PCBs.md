A breakout board for the LSM6DSL IMU from STMicroelectronics. It's pretty simple, just has the required components and pull-up resistors for I2C.

A very crude prototype of an EMG sensor. This is by no means a final product and just serves as a proof of concept to ensure that my idea actually works.
