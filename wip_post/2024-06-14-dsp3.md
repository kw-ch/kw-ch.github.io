Filtering is the process of removing unwanted components/features from a signal. In DSP, filtering is done by implementing an algorithm that corresponds to a filter's characteristics. 

# Frequency response of filters
Filters can be described based on which frequencies the filter rejects (the **stopband**) and which frequencies it passes (the **passband**):

- **Low-pass filter**: low frequencies are passed, high frequencies are rejected

- **High-pass filter**: high frequencies are passed, low frequencies are rejected

- **Band-pass filter**: only frequencies within a specified band are passed.

- **Notch/Band-stop filter**: only frequencies within a specified band are rejected

Along with them, we have a few associated terms used to describe their frequency response:
- **Cutoff frequency** is the frequency beyond which the filter will not pass signals. An ideal filter will completely remove all the frequency components of a signal after the cutoff frequency. The cutoff frequency is generally measured at an attenuation of 3 dB, at which point a signal's power is cut in half. 

- **Roll-off** is the rate at which the signal is attenuated beyond the cutoff frequency. An ideal filter has infinite roll-off, as all frequencies beyond the cutoff are completely removed. Ideal filters are pretty much impossible to actually achieve. In practice, filters have a **transition band** which is a region between the passband and stopband where the signal starts being attenuated.

- **Ripple** is the fluctuations in the filter's passband and is usually present as a trade-off for optimizing other aspects of the filter.

# Filter Types
With the above knowledge, we can classify filters into various types based on how their frequency responses look like. While there are many types of filters out there, four of them are the most commonly used and well-known. These are:

**Butterworth Filter**: The Butterworth filter is known for its *maximally flat* response in the passband, meaning it has little to no passband ripple. It also has a very steep roll-off. The trade-off for this is that it can introduce undesired delay (phase shift) into the output and has lower phase linearity<sup>1</sup>.

**Bessel Filter**: The Bessel Filter is optimized for phase linearity, ensuring constant delay in the passband. However the trade-off is a less steep roll-off. This makes it the filter of choice if phase response is the primary concern.

**Chebyshev Filter**: The Chebyshev Filter is known for its ripple, which can designed to either be in the passband (Chebyshev Type 1) or in the stopband (Chebyshev Type 2). The Chebyshev filter can get some of the most steepest roll-offs, but the amplitude of the ripple is proportional to the steepness of the roll-off, meaning if you want a steeper roll-off, you'll get more ripple.

**Elliptic Filter**: The Elliptic Filter is similar to the Chebyshev filter, except that it has ripple in *both* the passband and stopband. The upside of this is that the filter is able to achieve the steepest possible roll-off among these 4 filter types. If filter selectivity is key, then this is the choice. 


# Filters in the Time Domain - Step Response and Impulse Response
Besides the frequency response, filters can also be characterized by their impulse response and step response. These are filter's response when an impulse or a step function is applied to its input. The step response, impulse response and frequency response form a trio that each contains complete information of filter. If we know one of them, we can find the other two. 

The most straightforward way to implement a digital filter to signal is to convolve the signal with the impulse response of the filter. The output is calculated by weighting the samples in the input and adding them together. This can be mathematically represented by the following equation:

Another way of implementing filters is via **recursion**. Recursion involves a feedback mechanism, where previous outputs of the filter affects the current output. Rather than using the filter's impulse response, a set of **recursion coefficients** are used instead. But even if you don't use it, the filter still has an impulse response, and for recursive filters, you'd find that their impulse response is a series of sinusoids that exponentially decay in amplitude. This essentially makes their impulse response **infinitely long**, hence recursive filters are also called **Infinite Impulse Response** or **IIR** filters.

Correspondingly, filters that are implementing via convolution are known as **Finite Impulse Response** or **FIR** filters.

While it may seem that the impulse response and frequency response seems to be much more important than the step response, the step response is also a crucial characteristic of filters. A filter's step response essentially tells us how fast the filter can respond to changes in the input. This is usually represented by the **rise time** which is essentially how fast the output of the signal can rise from 10% of the amplitude to 90% of the amplitude. For example, here are two step responses with a slower one on the left and a faster one on the right:

The step response can also tell us about the presence of **overshoot**, which is where the filter's output exceeds the final steady-state value. Note that overshoot here is caused by the filter, not by the signal itself.

The step response also lets us know whether the filter has phase linearity.

# Filters in Python
Now let's take a look at some filtering examples in Python using the `scipy` package, which has built-in functions for filter design. 

Let's first look at an FIR filter. A standard method in FIR filter design is the use of the **Remez Exchange Algorithm**, which is used to calculate the optimum FIR filter coefficients given a desired response. 

To design an FIR filter with the above algorithm in Python, we can make use of the function `scipy.signal.remez`. 

`scipy.signal.remez(numtaps, bands, desired, *, weight=None, Hz=<object object>, type='bandpass', maxiter=25, grid_density=16, fs=None)`

Let's look at the function parameters:

# Footnotes
1. Phase linearity is a property of a filter where the phase response is a linear function of frequency. This means that every frequency component of the input signal would experience an identical time shift after going through the filter. This time shift is known as **group delay**. A nonlinear phase means that different components of the signal would be delayed by different amounts of time, causing time-domain distortion in the signal.
